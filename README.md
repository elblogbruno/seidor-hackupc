Inspiration
SeiVoice was born to transform purchasing and management in supermarkets through natural voice interaction, improving both the customer experience and operational efficiency.

What it does
SeiVoice allows users to add products and manage orders using voice commands, offering assistance to both customers and employees in supermarkets and warehouses. In addition, it can maintain a deeper conversation on various topics thanks to its intelligence (LLM) and its ability to obtain information from different sources such as the Internet or the environment thanks to its sensors.

How we built it
SeiVoice is not only a voice assistant, but also an IOT device that allows the assistant to be more effective because it acquires information from the context of the environment. For this, a Raspberry pi 4 was used, which has the server that controls the assistant in addition to the sensors. (Of temperature).

We can have any kind of LLM and we added our direct knowdledge of seidor, the whole internet and many more things, givin the LLM distinct tools to act on its own to help you.

Then we have a multiplarform but think primarily for smartphones client that allows the worker or client use the assistant witouth event touching the screen.

Challenges we ran into
make the assistant learn the store/supermarket database
that the assistant has memory
conflicts in package versions in flutter development
Accomplishments that we're proud of
the AI ​​has learned the content of our use case
design
having reached the goal of doing the third option of the challenge
What we learned
We learned about the practical application of AI in real environments and improved our skills in software development and technical problem solving under pressure.

What's next for SeiVoice
Make the LLM data process and pipeline better, fix issues with it and also go more for the local part of having an LLM on your laptop so it is 100% secure.
